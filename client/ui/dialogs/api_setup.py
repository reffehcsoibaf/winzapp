"""
api_setup.py — WinZapp's single WPPConnect Server setup/repair dialog.

One dialog, two possible operations — decided automatically at the start of
_run_setup() by checking whether api/dist/server.js already exists, never by
which code path constructed the dialog. This used to be two near-identical
dialogs (ApiSetupDialog here, plus a separate ModuleInstallDialog) with
different titles for what a user experienced as "the same install screen" —
consolidated into this one so there is only ever one thing shown, whatever
state api/ is actually in:

  api/dist/server.js absent → full setup (nothing cloned yet, or the whole
  api/ folder was deleted):
    1. Download the WPPConnect Server source ZIP from GitHub (no git required)
         • No tag  → branch main  archive
         • With tag → specific tag archive
    2. Extract into client/api/, keeping the upstream ZIP away from our own
       root files (start.js, .env, config.json), then restoring every WinZapp
       patch from api_patches/ and merging our pinned dependencies into
       package.json — the same patch set setup_api.py applies, so an end-user
       install and a developer one end up with identical API code
    3. npm install --no-audit --no-fund      (install all dependencies)
    4. npm exec puppeteer browsers install <chrome on Windows, chrome-headless-shell
       elsewhere — must match start.js's findPreferredChrome()> (best-effort)
    5. npm run db:generate                   (only if the script is defined)
    6. npm run build                         (compile TypeScript → dist/server.js)

  api/dist/server.js present → modules-only repair (already cloned/built,
  just node_modules is missing — the normal state of every fresh WinZapp.zip
  extract, since node_modules isn't bundled to keep the download small):
    Steps 3-5 above only — no download/extract/build, since there is nothing
    to fetch and what's already built doesn't need rebuilding.

Note: db:deploy / db:deploy:win are NOT run here.  Prisma migrations require
a live PostgreSQL connection, which is only available at runtime.  The
migrations are applied automatically by start.js every time the API starts.

The WPPCONNECT_TAG_VERSION variable in the root .env optionally pins a specific
tag.  When unset the latest main branch is downloaded.

Uses only the standard library (zipfile, io, tempfile) plus the already-present
requests package for the HTTP download — no git installation required.

Modal result:
  wx.ID_OK     — setup succeeded; caller may proceed
  wx.ID_CANCEL — user cancelled or an error occurred; caller should exit

# "tokens" is the one that actually holds the paired WhatsApp session:
# wppconnect-server's file token store (config.ts `tokenStoreType: 'file'`)
# writes to `./tokens` relative to process.cwd(), which is client/api/ — see
# src/util/tokenStore/FileTokenStore/FileTokenStore.ts (`path: './tokens'`).
# It was missing from this set, so the clean step below deleted every stored
# session token on each full reinstall/update while userDataDir (the Chrome
# profile) survived. What that costs is spelled out by WinZapp's own patch
# in api_patches/src/util/createSessionUtil.ts, which exists to stop the
# same token being destroyed by a different route: "The saved WhatsApp Web
# credentials are then gone for good and the next start looks like a logout,
# even though the phone still lists the linked device." Nothing recreates
# the file, so whatever state that leaves the session in survives every
# restart — which is what "ao reinstalar a WPPConnect o programa fica em
# modo offline permanente, mesmo ao reiniciar" describes.
#
# "wppconnect_tokens" is kept alongside it purely for older installs. It is
# the folder name upstream used before "tokens" (both are still listed in
# api/.gitignore) and nothing writes to it any more — it is empty on a
# current install — but dropping it here would delete whatever an old
