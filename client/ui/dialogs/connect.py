        saved session — either because WhatsApp is confirmed connected right
        now, or because nothing has actually confirmed it is NOT, which is
        just as important and easy to miss.

        Reported live: status-session read 'disconnectedMobile', which
        _act_on_unlink_decision() (main.py) classifies as RESUMING — its
        own docstring calls this a transient, recoverable state and
        deliberately does not wipe anything for it. Ten seconds later,
        WPPConnect minted a fresh QR with no dialog open, and
        _show_repair_dialog() (websocket_client.py) opened this dialog on
        the strength of that QR alone — its own docstring reasons that an
        unattended QR means the stored session "can't be restored" and
        therefore Cancel/close/Quit have "nothing left to lose". That
        premise was false here: main.py's own, more careful classifier had
        independently looked at the very same disconnect and judged it
        recoverable. The user dismissed the unexpected dialog (its Cancel
        button carries wx.ID_CANCEL, so a plain Escape reaches it too) and
        the session was destroyed anyway, on a signal main.py itself was
        not yet willing to act on.
        _logout_handled (main.py) is the one place that distinction already
        lives: _act_on_unlink_decision() sets it only for a decision that
        actually authorizes a wipe (LOGOUT confirmed by the host-device
        probe, or RESUME_FAILED after repeated strikes) — never for
        RESUMING, and never merely because a QR arrived. Folding it in here
        means Cancel/Escape/Quit are only ever destructive once main.py's
        own, much more careful machinery has independently reached the same
        conclusion — not on the say-so of a lone QR event.
