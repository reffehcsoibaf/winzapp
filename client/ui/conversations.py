        A wx.ListCtrl row is one MSAA object whose *name* is the whole rendered
        line, so rewriting a row to add "reproduzido" raises a name change, and
        NVDA speaks the **entire row** — but only when that row is the object it
        currently believes has focus. So the fix is not to time the write, it is
        to never write the row NVDA is looking at while focus is moving away
        from it.

        The previous protection tried to order the two events instead: move
        focus, then fire the "played" refresh from the same callback,
        documented as "this can't lose the race because both actions run in the
        same callback, in this order". It could, for two measured reasons:

        * ``refresh_message_status()`` does not write anything — it queues the
          row and starts a 120 ms coalescing timer. Measured on the real code
          path, the write landed 142 ms *after* the focus move. That is a
          margin, not a guarantee, and users on several machines with current
          NVDA reported it losing.
        * Worse, that margin can go negative. ``mark_audio_message_played()``
          also POSTs a played receipt to WhatsApp, which echoes the same status
          back over Socket.IO onto ``on_message_status_update()`` with
          ``skip_panel_refresh=False`` — bypassing the chain protection
          entirely. Measured on the real code path: the row was written 95 ms
          *before* the focus move, so NVDA read the whole finished row out and
          only then announced the newly focused one. That is exactly the
          reported symptom, and it is a hole the ordering approach cannot cover
          because the second write does not come through the chain at all.

        Holding removes both: during the chain nothing is written, so there is
        no event to lose a race with. At release time focus sits on the last
        voice note of the sequence while every held row is an earlier one, so
        each name change lands on a non-focused object and NVDA stays silent by
        its own rule — no timing assumption anywhere.

        Idempotent: the hold flag is cleared first, so the several places that
        can end a sequence (the last voice note, the user stopping playback,
        leaving the conversation) may all call this without writing the rows
        twice. It does NOT check whether the chain is still running — call it
        only once the sequence is genuinely over, which is why the call sites
        sit next to where _is_in_audio_chain is cleared.

        A contagem é o piso e o id da mensagem mais antiga exibida é a âncora:
        cada mensagem nova aumenta o total de exibíveis, e uma janela definida
        só por contagem andaria uma linha para frente a cada chegada, comendo
        de volta justamente o histórico que o usuário pediu. Quando esse id
        some (mensagem apagada remotamente), a contagem ainda segura a janela.

        Chamado por quem carrega histórico (Home) E pelo fim de
        populate_messages(): o piso não é "o que o Home trouxe", é "o que já
        está na tela". Sem a segunda chamada, uma conversa aberta e nunca
        expandida abre com messages_page_size linhas, cresce por append a cada
        mensagem que chega ou que o usuário manda (on_incoming_message() e os
        caminhos de envio otimista apendam sem cortar nada), e o primeiro
        rebuild de fundo recalcula a janela do fim e devolve a lista a
        exatamente o page size — apagando da lista, sob o leitor de tela, uma
        linha antiga por mensagem nova. Foi assim que o bug reapareceu depois
        da âncora: com 200 linhas na tela, 4 mensagens enviadas e o repaint
        seguinte, as 4 mais antigas sumiram.

        "O que está na tela" inclui o alargamento que paginated_window() faz
        por causa do separador de não lidas, e não só o histórico que o usuário
        puxou: um grupo com 4000 não lidas abre com 4001 linhas, e essas 4001
        viram o piso da sessão inteira — o separador ser descartado depois não
        as estreita. É de propósito. Apará-las é apagar da lista, sob o leitor
        de tela, exatamente as mensagens que ele acabou de ler, que é o bug.
        Quem for medir custo de rebuild em conversa nunca expandida precisa
        saber que essa janela larga é esperada, não defeito.

        Uma lista só com sentinela (o placeholder de "sem mensagens") não
        registra nada: um piso de 1 linha não significa nada e a âncora vazia
        não prenderia coisa alguma. Também não zera o que já estava gravado, e
        isso é escolha, não esquecimento: "Limpar conversa" esvazia records e
        cai aqui, mas um records momentaneamente vazio no meio de um resync
        cairia igual, e zerar ali derrubaria um piso legítimo — de novo linhas
        sumindo sob o leitor. O custo de manter é o oposto e é suportável: se o
        chat limpo voltar a encher na mesma sessão, o rebuild seguinte pinta
        uma janela mais larga que o page size até a conversa ser fechada.

        ``hold_for_echo=False`` is for a send that is already OVER: an
        unconfirmed one (_send_unconfirmed), where the worker finished and
        reported long ago. cancel() returns False for it — not because a worker
        still owns the message, but because it is no longer in the queue at all
        — so without this flag it would take the hold-for-echo tail below and
        be stashed waiting for an outcome report that has already happened and
        will never come again. The record would sit in the chat forever:
        invisible (_is_displayable_message and _counts_as_last_message both
        refuse _cancelled_awaiting_id), re-persisted on every save, and holding
        a slot in _cancelled_pending_messages. Nor can the echo matcher claim
        it, since that only considers _local_pending records and an unconfirmed
        one has that False.

        There is no WhatsApp message ID to revoke yet, so whichever scope the
        delete dialog had selected, this cancels the queued/in-flight send and
        applies a local deletion; asking the API for "everyone" here can only
        fail.

        When cancel() reports the send was stopped for good that is the whole
        story. When it does not — a worker already owns the message — the row
        still goes, but the *record* deliberately stays behind, marked
        _cancelled_awaiting_id and still _local_pending. That record is what
        on_new_message()'s by-type echo matching binds the echo to: the echo
        carries no correlation ID, so with this message's record gone the
        matcher would hand its WhatsApp ID to the next unrelated pending send of
        the same type, and no amount of registering IDs afterwards fixes that —
        the echo can (and routinely does) arrive before the send call has even
        returned. _counts_as_last_message() ignores the marker, so the chat list
        does not show a message the user just deleted, and the record is dropped
        or resolved for real the moment the queue reports the outcome (see

        on_new_message() deliberately never appends a reactionMessage to a
        chat's `records` itself, so this is the ONLY thing that files a live
        reaction anywhere — and it used to run behind
        on_incoming_message()'s "is this conversation open?" guard, which
        meant a reaction to a chat the user was not looking at (the normal
        case: the toast for it only ever fires while the window is in the
        background) was applied nowhere at all. It showed up as a
        notification and then simply did not exist: opening the conversation
        afterwards rebuilds _reaction_map by scanning `records`, which never
        received it.

        _reaction_map, by contrast, only ever describes the conversation
        currently rendered in messages_list — populate_messages() rebuilds it
        from scratch per conversation — so it is only touched when this
        reaction really belongs to that conversation.

        inteira entre as duas assinaturas foi coberta assim; quem chama
        reconstrói quando não foi.

        É o caso mais comum que sobrou passando pelo rebuild: mensagem nova. O
        painel já a acrescenta ao vivo em on_incoming_message(), mas o refresh
        de fundo que vem segundos depois (sync_chat_messages() ->
        _refresh_open_conversation_after_sync(), o backfill de histórico, a
        rodada de 60s) só sabia comparar a assinatura e chamar
        populate_messages(): DeleteAllItems() mais um Append() por linha, para
        pintar de novo o que já estava na tela — numa janela que agora pode ter
        milhares de linhas. Mesma ideia de _repaint_message_rows(), que já faz
        isso para estrela/fixar/apagar, e de refresh_chat_row_text() na lista de
        conversas.

        Na prática o caminho normal acrescenta ZERO linha: a mensagem já foi
        pintada ao vivo, e o que este método faz é reconhecer isso e adotar a
        assinatura, transformando o rebuild seguinte em nada. Acrescentar de
        fato é o caminho de quem chegou pelo sync sem passar pelo live.

        Recusa tudo que não seja "linhas novas no fim, nada mais mudou", porque
        aí o rebuild é a única coisa que sabe onde a linha vai:

        - qualquer linha existente que mudou de texto ou sumiu (a comparação
          por id de _signature_changed_ids(), que já devolve None sozinha para
          conversa trocada, separador movido ou id vazio/repetido);
        - registro novo que não vira linha — a reação é o caso comum: ela muda
          o texto de OUTRA linha, e a assinatura não diz de qual;
        - registro novo mais antigo que a última linha, que entraria no meio da
          lista ordenada por timestamp, não no fim;
        - qualquer reordenação dos registros antigos, que a comparação por id
          não veria e o sort estável do rebuild veria;
        - lista fora de passo com o controle, lista vazia (acrescentar na lista
          vazia com foco reproduz o pulo de foco para a linha 0 que o Freeze()
          de populate_messages() documenta) e a lista de placeholder;
        - o sufixo ", N de M" ligado (ver _row_position_suffix_active()).

        Uma exceção à recusa por registro não exibível: reação a um status
        NOSSO é linha de verdade (_is_displayable_message() ->
        reaction_targets_status()), então ela é acrescentada como qualquer
        mensagem. O rebuild também a poria em _reaction_map, e o atalho não —
        sem divergência visível, porque essa entrada é chaveada por um id de
        status@broadcast, que não tem linha nesta conversa para decorar.

        Consequência deliberada, não efeito colateral: o separador de não
        lidas que on_incoming_message() insere ao vivo sobrevive a este
        refresh, e é seguro porque só se acrescenta na cauda: _unread_sep_idx
        continua apontando para a mesma linha e _dismiss_unread_separator()
        continua funcionando. A assimetria que existia aqui — o separador ao
        vivo era removido pelo primeiro rebuild que qualquer OUTRA mudança
        provocasse, porque este caminho não gravava _first_unread_msg_id — foi
        fechada do outro lado: _update_unread_separator_for_incoming() grava a
        âncora e a contagem, e _place_unread_separator_for_rebuild() as lê de
        volta.

        missing everything except unarchive/clear/delete. Ctrl+F (search) and
        Ctrl+N (new conversation) are left out: this panel has no search field
        of its own, and Ctrl+W (close conversation) doesn't apply — there is no
        split conversation view to close from this list. Ctrl+Shift+Q always
        means "unarchive" here rather than toggling, since every row is
