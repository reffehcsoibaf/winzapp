// DO NOT MERGE UPSTREAM'S dotenv LOADING INTO THIS FILE.
//
// wppconnect-server 2.10.19 added `dotenv.config({ override: false })` here
// (commit b66881b, "load and document optional environment configuration"),
// and removed the dead `//require('dotenv').config();` from index.ts at the
// same time. Both are inert for WinZapp and one of them is actively unsafe, so
// this patch keeps overriding them — deliberately, not by accident.
//
// Inert, because this file is not a variant of upstream's: upstream resolves
// every setting from process.env (`env.SECRET_KEY || ...`, `env.PORT ||
// '21465'`, `envNumber('MAX_LISTENERS', 15)`), while WinZapp hardcodes them
// below and reads exactly ONE environment variable. There is no `env` object
// here for a .env file to feed.
//
// Unsafe, because that one variable is WINZAPP_USER_DATA_DIR, and it is the
// path to the Chrome profile that carries the WhatsApp login — computed per
// install and per account by main.py, and the single thing that must never
// come from a file lying next to the exe. dotenv's `override: false` protects
// a variable we DO inject; it does nothing about a stale value inherited by a
// process that was launched without one. Pointing Chrome at the wrong
// userDataDir is the session-loss failure mode, not a configuration nicety.
// WinZapp also deliberately stopped shipping a .env (see
// wpp_minimum_version.txt's own history), so installs upgraded from older
// builds can still have one on disk.
//
// Consequence to know about: upstream's src/config.test.ts (added in the same
// commit) asserts secretKey 'THISISMYSECURETOKEN' from a .env and port '21465'
// by default. Against this file all three of its cases fail, by design.
// Nothing in WinZapp runs jest — setup_api.py and build.py only ever run
// `npm run build` — and tsconfig.json's `src*` include does compile it, which
// type-checks fine. So it costs nothing today; it is written down here so a
// future rebase does not "fix" the failure by merging the dotenv call in.

// customUserDataDir is used as `customUserDataDir + session` (string
// concatenation, not path.join) to build each session's Puppeteer/Chrome
// profile directory — see createSessionUtil.ts. Left as the literal default
// './userDataDir/' it resolves relative to the Node process's own cwd, which
// is only a stable, persistent location in a --onedir build or dev mode; in
// --onefile it is PyInstaller's per-launch extraction temp dir, so the whole
// WhatsApp Web browser profile (and therefore the paired session) is
// silently orphaned every time the app closes. main.py sets
// WINZAPP_USER_DATA_DIR to an absolute, install-writable path (with the
// trailing separator this concatenation needs) before spawning Node; the
// './userDataDir/' fallback below is only for running this server outside
// WinZapp entirely.

    // after a successful login — `startAutoClose(this.options.deviceSyncTimeout)`
