    // backslashes, and possibly 8.3-shortened components anywhere in the
    // install path (`PROGRA~1`-style) when it has spaces or long names.

    // 8.3 shortening of the parent directories. The `-like` metacharacters are

/**
 * Give WhatsApp Web a durable storage bucket.
 *
 * In a headless, freshly-created Chrome profile the persistent-storage
 * permission defaults to 'prompt', and since there is nobody to answer a
 * prompt Chrome resolves it to a denial: navigator.storage.persist() returns
 * false and WhatsApp Web logs
 *   [storage] storage bucket persistence denied (aquire-persistent-storage-denied)
 * A non-durable bucket still works — it is merely evictable under storage
 * pressure — so this is a robustness fix, not the history-sync fix. (What
 * actually stalled history sync was the blanket request interception hanging
 * the backend worker's cross-origin imports; see the long note in start.js.)
 *
 * Two details, both measured against this exact Chrome build rather than
 * assumed, because getting either wrong leaves the grant silently ineffective:
 *
 *   * The CDP session must stay attached. `Browser.grantPermissions` is a
 *     session-scoped override — detaching resets the origin straight back to
 *     'prompt'. The earlier version of this function called cdp.detach()
 *     immediately after granting, which is why the log kept reporting
 *     permission 'prompt' and persisted false even though the grant itself
 *     succeeded. The session is parked on the page so it outlives this call.
 *
 *   * No puppeteer overridePermissions() here. That call replaces the whole
 *     granted set for the origin, so asking for ['notifications'] flips
 *     durableStorage from 'prompt' to 'denied' — measurably worse than doing
 *     nothing. The CDP grant below covers notifications anyway.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: never throw from here.

   * runs before isConnected() is confirmed, so window.WPP routinely isn't

   * 'load' once connected — so a failed first try used to mean the listener

  /**
   * WinZapp patch: detect incoming WhatsApp calls by injecting a listener
   * directly into the WhatsApp Web page via page.evaluate, bypassing
   * wppconnect's own client.onIncomingCall() wrapper which stopped working
   * after a WhatsApp Web VoIP stack change (wa-js 4.5.0 bug, fixed in 4.6.0).
   *
   * Uses the same page.exposeFunction + page.evaluate pattern as
   * onUnreadCountChanged above. Two detection layers are installed:
   *
   *   1. WPP.on('call.incoming_call') — the wa-js event itself, in case the
   *      issue is only in wppconnect's wrapper and not in wa-js's internal
   *      registration.
   *   2. Direct Store access — if WPP exposes the internal CallStore/CallCollection,
   *      we hook its 'add' event directly, bypassing wa-js's event plumbing
   *      entirely.
   *
   * If both layers fire for the same call, the Python side receives two
   * events. This is harmless: the sound plays idempotently and the toast
   * deduplicates by nature (Windows suppresses identical toasts within a
   * short window).
   *
   * If neither layer works (WhatsApp changed too much), nothing breaks —
   * every call is wrapped in try/catch and failures are logged.
