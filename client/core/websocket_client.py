    # How many unattended QR/pairing-code events in a row are required before

    # careful check_wa_connection_http()/_act_on_unlink_decision() strike
    # machinery for the exact same underlying "unlinked" reading — a real
    # log captured that machinery logging "resuming — data preserved" (not

    # a QR event earlier for, seconds apart. Every other unlink-confirming
    # path in this codebase requires more than a single reading before
    # doing anything user-visible or destructive; this one now does too.
    #
    # What it buys is precisely that no single reading acts on its own —
    # not a guaranteed wait. Nothing on the unattended path dedups by
    # payload (the value check lives in _update_ui()'s `phone` refresh
    # branch, which needs a dialog on screen), so two socket emissions
    # carrying the SAME code satisfy this counter without any of WhatsApp's
    # ~20-30s rotation having passed. In the steady-state flood this was
    # written for the codes really are rotating and it does cost one
    # rotation, the same price every other confirmation here accepts for
    # not alarming a session that was only ever transiently unhappy; in a
    # boot-time burst it costs almost nothing, which is why
    # _qr_within_startup_grace() is a separate requirement rather than a
    # stronger version of this one. Still under _UNATTENDED_QR_LIMIT
    # either way, so the dialog is offered before the harsher close-session
    # action — and _handle_unattended_qr() offers it after that action too,
    # for the paired install a burst inside the grace window carried
    # straight past this counter.
    #
    # The halt itself moves by one event, in both directions, and that is
    # this counter's whole cost in codes actually requested from WhatsApp.
    # Measured on a paired install by counting past the limit rather than
    # stopping at it: outside the grace the halt lands on the 5th unattended
    # code instead of the 4th (this counter withholds the dialog for one
    # extra event, and the dialog is what used to reset the count); inside
    # the grace it lands on the 3rd instead of the 4th, since nothing resets
    # the count there at all. Bounded at +-1 either way — never a widening
    # window, which is the property that matters for an account that was
    # banned over code volume.
    #
    # The profile repair adds its own, separate allowance:
    # _recover_suspect_profile() zeroes this counter when a restore actually
    # succeeds (main.py), because the burst that triggered it was minted by
    # the profile now moved aside. That zeroing happens on the restore
    # thread, with close-session, wait_for_profile_release and a copy of a
    # few hundred MB between the trigger and it — so it is NOT one event
    # later, and writing it as if it were understates the one number an
    # account was banned over. By the time it lands, 1 or 2 codes have
    # usually been counted already and those are not given back; what the
    # reset does hand back is the run-up, since the count towards this
    # constant starts again from 0. Bounded, because the branch that starts
    # the restore has already passed both gates and every route out of it
    # returns above the halt: the reset can only push the *dialog* out by up
    # to _REPAIR_DIALOG_CONFIRM_EVENTS - 1 further codes, and the dialog then
    # resets the counter itself (_reset_unattended_qr_guards()). See
    # TestTheProfileIsRepairedBeforeAskingTheUserToPair for both orderings,
    # and tests/test_profile_recovery_wiring.py::
    # TestASuccessfulRestoreGivesBackTheQrFloodAllowance for the production
    # line the fake there stands in for.
    #
    # Once per recovery, and a launch is no longer bounded to one of those:
    # _recover_suspect_profile() latches, but a connection that comes back up
    # hands that latch straight back (main.py's _set_wa_connected() — a
    # snapshot that connected has proved itself and may be restored again if
    # it breaks later in the same run). That does not widen this window: the
    # re-arm now lives in the same branch as this counter's own
    # `self._unattended_qr_events = 0`, so the two are one event by
    # construction, and the second allowance can only ever be spent on a
    # second flood, which had its own full ceiling regardless.
    #
    # It used to live on the bare status string in
    # _note_status_for_profile_health(), which is a weaker reading — the live
    # isConnected() probe had not agreed yet. A CONNECTED the probe went on
    # to refuse gave the recovery back without giving the counter back, so a
    # second recovery could start mid-flood on an event the counter had
    # already counted; _handle_unattended_qr() returns the moment one starts
    # (`if mw._recover_suspect_profile(...): return`, above the halt), and
    # landing on the very event where `seen` reached _UNATTENDED_QR_LIMIT
    # stopped the halt being evaluated at all rather than postponing it,
    # because that test is `==` and `seen` only grows. Fixed in #209 by
    # moving the re-arm to the probe-agreeing branch; the seam this paragraph
    # describes is closed, and the paragraph is kept because the shape is
    # worth recognising if either half is ever moved again.
    #
    # Note what did NOT move with it: the generation ladder
    # (_profile_recovery_generation, which chooses WHICH snapshot a restore
    # reaches for) still resets on the status-string reading, deliberately —
    # it never interacts with this counter, and it needs to be re-asserted on
    # every poll rather than once per transition to survive a launch whose
    # pairing completes before prepare_sync() has opened the database. See
    # main.py's comment at that call site.
    #
    # Gating the re-arm on _wa_connected instead was the obvious alternative
    # and does not work: it delays the recovery by a whole poll (~30 s) and
    # breaks the case it was added for — _note_status_for_profile_health()
    # measured 11 s between a restored profile connecting and a superseded
    # session start force-killing its browser.

        than a slow boot still settling.

        A previously-paired install that has genuinely lost its session can
        start emitting QR codes within seconds of a fresh (re)connect — a
        real log measured one 11 s after startup, while /list-chats was
        still 404ing because the session itself had not finished starting.
        Nothing about a QR event makes it immune to the exact race the
        startup grace exists for elsewhere; it only looks immune because,
        unlike a bare status string, a code is often also genuinely
        conclusive.

        Reads exactly the pair check_wa_connection_http()'s own
        `within_grace` reads, so the two windows open and close together.
        They are cleared as a pair by the four places that treat what

        Usually that means no pairing dialog is on screen at all; see the

        attended.

        Two things have to happen, and only the first one used to: tell the
        user, and stop the session asking WhatsApp for more codes.

        Telling the user is the proactive pairing dialog — WPPConnect only
        generates a code once it has already decided the stored session can't
        be restored, so a code with no dialog open is close to a reliable
        "you need to re-pair" signal on its own — closer than the coarse
        status-session string the health-check poll watches, which needs
        several minutes of confirmation to rule out a normal slow boot. Not
        immune to that same class of false positive, though, in two
        different ways: a code observed seconds into a (re)connect attempt
        races the same stored-session restore the status-session poll is
        still waiting on, so _qr_within_startup_grace() below withholds
        judgment for exactly the window that poll already gets
        (_WA_STARTUP_GRACE_SECONDS) — see
        tests/test_qrcode_auto_repair_dialog.py::TestStartupGraceWindow. And
        a single reading, however it arrives, is not what any *other*
        unlink-confirming path in this codebase accepts either — see
        _REPAIR_DIALOG_CONFIRM_EVENTS, which requires this one too.

        Stopping the churn is the part whose absence got an account banned.
        `autoClose`/`deviceSyncTimeout` are pinned to 0 (client/api_patches/
        src/config.ts) so WPPConnect never closes a code-producing session on
        its own — deliberately, because a blind user needs unbounded time to
        pair. That is the right answer while somebody is looking at the
        dialog and the wrong one when nobody is: an app sitting in the tray
        with a dropped session kept re-requesting a code every half minute
        for hours. Nothing can consume those codes, so closing the session is
        pure gain here; the user re-pairs from the dialog, which starts a
        fresh session of its own.

        Wider than the branch it replaced in one more way: that one required
        base64_img, so an event carrying only a pairingCode escaped it
        entirely. Both kinds of code are equally unscannable with nobody
        watching, and equally worth a request to WhatsApp, so both count here.

        Reached from _handle_unattended_qr() by three routes, and every one
        of them means the signal has been confirmed rather than acted on once.
        Two cleared that method's own bar — outside the startup grace window
        and confirmed by _REPAIR_DIALOG_CONFIRM_EVENTS consecutive readings,
        not a single one — and differ only in what the profile repair then
        did with it: called inline when _recover_suspect_profile() refused to
        start one (no snapshot, or the once-per-launch budget already spent),
        and handed to it as on_give_up for the restore that started and then
        failed. The third runs when the grace/counter withheld those two and
        the flood then spent the entire _UNATTENDED_QR_LIMIT inside that
        window, which is a stronger reading still.

        The last two run behind something that has already played error_sound
        — _announce_profile_beyond_repair() on the give-up route, the halt on
        the third — which is what play_sound=False is for; see those call
        sites. The inline route keeps the sound: its no-snapshot sub-case
        announces too and so doubles the cue, but its budget-spent sub-case
        has played nothing at all, and one flag at one call site cannot tell
        them apart. A cue too many on a route that is sometimes silent is the
        safe direction to be wrong in; silence on a route that is sometimes
        the only cue is not. Either way, by the time this runs the signal
        is at least as solid as the coarse status-session string the poll
        watches (which needs several minutes of confirmation to rule out a
        normal slow boot). Surfacing the pairing dialog immediately —
        instead of leaving the user staring at "offline"
        for however long _AUTO_RESTART_LOGOUT_GRACE_SECONDS or the
        multi-minute unlink confirmation takes with no explanation — was an
        explicit, accepted tradeoff: this dialog's own Cancel/close buttons
        quit the app / drop the WebSocket for good, which is fine here
        specifically because a session that reached this point has nothing
        left to lose by closing — see the conversation this was decided in.

        Everything else this handler does is a log entry, and until now that
        was the whole of it: `_phone_code_error` is read only by connect.py's
        90 s phoneCode wait, which has long since returned by the time the
        pairing dialog is on screen. Both names routed here can *only* arrive
        after it — on wppconnect 2.3.2 wa-js re-mints on its own 195 s timer
        and stops after five refreshes, so an attended dialog gets roughly six
        codes over ~19.5 minutes and then `LinkCodeExpired`. Left in the log,
        the dialog goes on showing the last, now-dead code and reading it back
        exactly as before: the user types it, WhatsApp refuses, they cancel and
        retry, and the retry mints a fresh session and another six codes —
        the anti-abuse loop update_pairing_code()'s own docstring describes.

        `LinkCodeRefreshFailed` is that same ending reached sooner, which is
        why it is announced too rather than left as the log line it used to be.
        wa-js clears the 195 s timer before minting and only re-arms it from a
        successful mint, so a refresh that fails ends the stream then and there
        — no timer, no code, the rejection swallowed by its own caller, and
        `conn.link_code_expired` unreachable unless WhatsApp Web itself pushes
        `refresh_alt_linking_code`, which is not something to wait on. The user
        is left with a code wa-js already discarded, at t+195 s rather than
        ~19.5 minutes: the unannounced case stranded them earlier than the
        announced one. The name is minted by the host.layer.js hook, which is
        the only side that knows whether a code was ever on screen — a *first*
        mint failing reports `LinkCodeError` instead and stays silent here,
        since loginByCode()'s own retry ladder and the 90 s wait already own
        that case.

        Keyed on `_is_pairing_dialog_active()`, which asks about
        `connection_dial` rather than `pairing_dial`: a user who cancelled the
        code sub-dialog but is still on the method chooser hears "cancel and
        try again" for a code they already walked away from. Accepted rather
        than narrowed — it is accurate about the attempt they just made, and
        the alternative (a second signal for "the code widget is up") buys a
        few seconds of silence at the cost of another two-signal rule to keep
        in step.

        `rate_limited` splits off the one ending where "cancel and try again"
        is the wrong advice. WhatsApp refusing on quota grounds is reachable
        here — every manual retry mints a fresh session and up to six codes,
        and 10 codes in 12 minutes was enough to earn IQErrorRateOverlimit —
        and telling the user to retry immediately is precisely what keeps the
        quota spent. connect.py's `_on_pairing_code_error()` already reached
        that conclusion for the first mint; this is the same conclusion on the
        channel that carries every *later* failure, i.e. the one the 90 s
        phoneCode wait can no longer report on.

        Runs on the wx thread via CallAfter: _is_pairing_dialog_active() reads
        the dialog's own IsShown(), and Socket.IO delivers this on its thread.
