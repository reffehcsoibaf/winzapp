    Two sources, in order:

    1. ``_measured_seconds`` — what WinZapp read off the media file itself
       (see ui/conversations.probe_media_duration). This is the only place a
       0 is believed: the file said so, and a clip under a second really does
       round to 0 there. WhatsApp shows "0:00" for such a thing, so we do too.

    2. ``seconds`` — what the message arrived with, and only when above zero.
       WhatsApp Web hands over duration 0 whenever the sending client left the
       field out of the message (confirmed against /get-messages for such a
       video: `duration` is the string "0", and no other field on the payload
       or its mediaData carries the real length). No video lasts no time, so
       announcing "duração: 0 segundos" from that states a length that is
       certainly wrong — reported as exactly that on a video that plays for
       minutes.

    So a stated 0 means "not stated", a measured 0 means "really that short",
    and the two are no longer the same answer. Audio never needed the
    distinction: a voice note under a second genuinely reports its own 0, and
    that path keeps treating it as a real value.

    Either value may arrive as an int or as a string depending on which layer
    normalized it (WebSocketClient._media_seconds() casts, a record restored
    straight from a REST sync may not) — "0" is truthy, so this cannot be a
    plain falsiness check at the call site.

    marks), so "reuniao" finds "reunião" and "acao" finds "ação" — what a

    ``nfkd`` folds the accents too, and on top of that the *compatibility*

    Folding is offered rather than imposed because it is not free: in
    languages where an accent changes the word (Spanish "año"/"ano", French
    "sur"/"sûr") the exact one becomes unsearchable, and NFKD goes further
    still by erasing distinctions that are sometimes meaningful. Which trade
    is worth making is the user's call, not this function's.

    much: only marks that decomposition actually separates from their base

    core/spell_checker.py's spell_check_mode() already knows how to read the

    backfill_missing_defaults() inserts the new key (it is in DEFAULT_SETTINGS)
    on the first launch after the update, before anything has read the setting,
    so every later call finds a recognised mode and never looks at the legacy
    value. A user who had turned spell checking off got it back on, while their
    settings.json still said ``spell_check_enabled: false`` — the setting
    looking honoured is what makes that hard to notice.

    Hence a migration rather than a read-time fallback, run from
    _migrate_settings() and therefore BEFORE the backfill that would otherwise
    invent the value this reads.

    Only an explicit False is carried across, matching what spell_check_mode()
    already decided: True was the default nobody chose, so it means "expressed
    no preference" and lands on the new default instead of being frozen into an
    override that would ignore Windows forever. An already-present
    ``spell_check_mode`` is never overwritten — that is a choice made under the
    new setting and outranks the old one.

    The flag is what keeps this one-shot: without it, a user who deliberately
    goes back to "follow Windows" would find it reverted to "off" on the next

    slides one row forward per arrival and eats back exactly the history that
    was loaded. ``anchor_id`` — the oldest message displayed at that moment —
    pins it instead, and the count stays as the floor for when that message is

    Both arguments are lists of row identities (WinZapp passes chat JIDs, which
    are unique within a list). Returns a list of ``("delete", index)`` /
    ``("insert", index)`` operations to apply **in order**, each index being
    valid against the control as it is being mutated. Returns None when the
    change isn't worth doing incrementally — the caller then rebuilds.

    Why this exists: a new message (or a reaction, or a read receipt) reorders
    the chat list, usually moving exactly one chat up. Rebuilding the whole
    wx.ListCtrl for that is O(rows) native calls plus a DeleteAllItems, which
    on an account with hundreds of chats is slow enough to see, and it hands
    screen readers a completely new list every time. One chat moving becomes
    two operations here regardless of how long the list is.

    The plan is greedy rather than provably minimal: rows that vanished are
    deleted first, then the remainder is walked against *new_rows* and any row
    that isn't already in place is moved (delete + insert) or inserted. For the
    shapes that actually occur — one chat moving, one chat appearing, one chat
    disappearing — that is already the minimum.

    *max_ops* caps how much churn is accepted before None is returned; it
    defaults to a third of the new length (minimum 4), past which a rebuild is
    both simpler and no slower.
