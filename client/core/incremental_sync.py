    metadata is stale for one chat, every signal agrees nothing changed and the
    chat is skipped on every round, forever, while get-messages for it would
    have returned newer messages the whole time. Nothing in the plan can break
    out of that, which is why the only cure users found was F5 — a forced full

    messages, ending at 08:35 and 07:34, that F5 advanced to 17:12 and 17:11
    by fetching 34 and 7 messages *newer* than anything stored).

    The history-repair queue does not cover it either: that asks the phone for
    history *older* than what is held, and these messages were newer.

    So staleness is bounded by time rather than trusted to the markers. The
    chats that have gone longest without a successful fetch are re-checked, a
    few per round, whatever the markers say. Returned oldest-first and capped,
    so the cost per round is fixed no matter how large the account is; a chat
