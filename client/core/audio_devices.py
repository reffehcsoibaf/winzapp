"""Enumeration and selection helpers for the Settings > Audio Devices tab.

Output (playback) device switching goes through sound_lib/BASS — a single
process-wide `Output` device, shared by every stream anywhere in the app
(program sounds, conversation audio, status audio). Input (recording) device
selection only affects PyAudio, used solely for voice-message recording in
`ui/conversations.py`.

Devices are stored in settings by friendly name, not raw index — BASS/PortAudio
device indices are not stable across reboots or device (dis)connections, so a

    offers either rate: a Bluetooth headset used as a *microphone*. Recording
    takes it out of A2DP and into the Hands-Free Profile, whose SCO link is
    mono at 8000 Hz (CVSD) or 16000 Hz (mSBC) — so every combination above is
    refused and the device looks broken.

    confined to Settings validation: the constant above says it must mirror
    _start_voice_recording()'s chain and does, so recording with that headset
    could not have worked either. The dialog was telling the truth about a
    limit that is WinZapp's, not the device's.

    Asking the device rather than widening the list is what makes this general:
    PortAudio already reports `defaultSampleRate`, which is the rate Windows
    has the endpoint opened at, so this covers 8000 and 16000 without naming
    them and covers whatever comes next for free. The fixed list stays as the
    tail, because `defaultSampleRate` is a *default*, not the only rate a
    device accepts, and a driver that reports one thing and accepts another
    was the situation this whole chain exists for.
