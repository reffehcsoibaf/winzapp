        **It could raise, and did.** `Output.free()` is BASS_Free(), which
        frees only the *current* device; `init_device(-1)` then BASS_Init's the
        system default — which apply_effects_device() has usually already
        initialised, because it pins effects to the concrete default index. So
        BASS_Init answered 14, "already initialized", and the exception escaped
        apply_output_device() (only the set_device() branch was ever wrapped),
        through settings_dialog._validate/_apply_values/_on_ok, to the global
        handler. Captured on a live install:

            File "core/sound_system.py", line 203, in _switch_to_default_device
            File "sound_lib/output.py", line 65, in init_device
            sound_lib.main.BassError: 14, already initialized/paused/whatever

        play() raised "invalid handle" or "BASS_Start has not been successfully
        called" — the endless errors while arrowing through voice messages.
        Being already initialised is success here, not failure.

        **It skipped the case that matters.** `if self.output._device == -1:
        return` reads "already on default, nothing to do", but the device
        BASS is bound to is a concrete one resolved when -1 was last passed. If
        that device then disappears — unplug a wireless dongle and let a USB
        device take over as default — BASS is still bound to a device that no
        longer exists, and this returned without touching it. That is bug one:
        nothing plays, and only switching the device away and back repairs it,
        because that is the one path that reaches the free/init.

        **-1 is not selectable.** BASS_Init accepts -1; BASS_SetDevice rejects
        it. So the default is resolved to its real index and selected
        explicitly, leaving BASS's current device and `output._device`
        agreeing with each other.
