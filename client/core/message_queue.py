"""
WinZapp Message Queue
---------------------
Background queue for outgoing messages (text and voice).

Behaviour
---------
* Immediate first attempt: the worker wakes up as soon as a message is
  enqueued, so the first send attempt is nearly instantaneous.
* Retry every 3 seconds on failure.
* In offline mode the worker loop is suspended until connectivity is
  restored; call ``flush()`` to wake it immediately when going back online.
* On success the UI is notified via ``wx.CallAfter`` so status labels update.
