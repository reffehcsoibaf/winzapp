Auto-updater for WinZapp.

Flow:
  1. UpdateChecker runs in a background thread at startup (if updates_enabled).
  2. If a newer version is found, show UpdateDialog on the main thread.
  3. User clicks "Sim" -> UpdateProgressDialog downloads the ZIP then installs.
  4. User clicks "Nao" -> retry in 3 hours.
  5. User clicks "Quais as novidades?" -> WhatsNewDialog shows changelog.
  6. After install: batch script waits for our PID, copies files, restarts.

        - `/releases` is the only place alpha builds appear, but it is PAGED

          neither draft nor prerelease. Alphas are published as prereleases, so
          this always resolves to the current stable release no matter how many
          alphas were published since — the exact guarantee paging can't give.

# ── WppUpdateChecker ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class WppUpdateChecker:
    """
    Periodically checks whether a newer wppconnect-server release exists than
    the one currently installed in client/api/ — independent of WinZapp's own
    release cycle. WPPConnect breaks upstream between WinZapp releases too,
    and until this existed the only fix was a user manually deleting
    client/api/ and node_modules so WinZapp would reinstall from scratch.

    Unlike UpdateChecker above, accepting the prompt here doesn't just
    download a new WinZapp build — it stops the *running* API session,
    reinstalls it in place (reusing ApiSetupDialog's ZIP-download flow, no
    git required, works in a compiled build), and restarts it. That's why the
    retry interval is much longer and the first check is delayed well past
    startup by the caller (see MainWindow._start_wpp_update_checker): this
    must never fire while pairing or the initial sync is still settling.

    Version comparison uses packaging.version.Version (plain semver), not
    parse_version()/is_newer() above — those are tailored to WinZapp's own
    hybrid date/semver tag scheme, which wppconnect-server's plain-semver
    tags (e.g. "2.5.3") don't follow.
