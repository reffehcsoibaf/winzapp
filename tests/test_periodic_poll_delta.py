"""What the 60-second background poll is allowed to do to the chat list.

WPPConnect Server never relays a socket event for anything changed on the phone
or another linked device, so this poll is the only way those reach WinZapp. It
used to answer that by re-syncing every chat's messages, which on a large
account is a full sync every minute; it now captures the same activity baseline
_run_sync() uses and queries only the chats whose marker moved.

Two properties of that are load-bearing and neither is visible from reading the
loop: the chat-list metadata save must wait for every selected delta to succeed
(a committed marker with no message behind it makes the next launch skip the
chat for good), and the poll must not promote history repairs to full re-syncs
— include_repairs=False — or the most expensive conversation on the account is
re-fetched in full once a minute, forever.

start_periodic_contacts_sync() spawns a thread running an endless loop, so the
loop is captured instead of started and one iteration is driven by hand.
MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated, so the method is bound to
a plain stub — the same pattern the other main.py tests use.
