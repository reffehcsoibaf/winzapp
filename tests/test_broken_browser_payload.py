"""A browser that cannot start must not be mistaken for a working install.

WinZapp ships its own Chromium under ``api/.cache``, and every "is the API set
up?" check looked only for the *executable*. Measured on a real install
(2026-09-10, WinZapp 1.1.0.2681alpha), where every session start died before a
browser existed::

    error: [<session>:browser] Failed to launch the browser process:  Code: 2147483651
    stderr:
    [0910/103543.323:ERROR:base\\i18n\\icu_util.cc:232] Invalid file descriptor to ICU data received.

``2147483651`` is ``0x80000003`` (STATUS_BREAKPOINT): Chromium aborted during
startup. The line above says why — it could not read ``icudtl.dat``. The
executable was present, so ``find_headless_shell()`` reported
``[headless-shell] Already installed: ...`` on every launch and nothing ever
looked again.

The expensive part was not the failed connection. ``ProfileHealthTracker``
counts sessions that die without connecting, which is precisely what a failed
browser launch produces, so the profile recovery fired for a fault that had
nothing to do with the profile, spent both snapshot generations on it, and left
the account unpaired — with no route back, because pairing needs the browser
that will not start::

    10:26:07  STARTUP ... paired=True  login_store=files=113 bytes=208775977
    10:27:39  profile suspect - session started and died 3x without connecting
    10:27:40  profile restored from snapshot
    10:30:20  Chrome released the profile before the kill  login_store=absent
    10:35:41  MainWindow: WhatsApp connection not paired. Showing connection dialog...
    10:36:14  [display_qrcode_image] No QR reached the screen (no QR within 25s)

``core/browser_payload.py`` is plain functions over a directory, so the
behaviour is exercised directly against real files here. The ``MainWindow``
halves are wx and cannot be instantiated, so they are bound to a stub the way
the rest of the suite does it.
