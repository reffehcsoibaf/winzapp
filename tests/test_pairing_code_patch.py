"""Tests for the pairing-code-rotation patch (GitHub issue #8) and its
later corrections.

Timeline:

* v0 (upstream bug, wppconnect-team/wppconnect#2836): host.layer.js's
  checkQrCode() dedupes the QR-image branch against `this.urlCode` before
  re-emitting it, but the phoneNumber (pairing-code) branch returns
  straight into loginByCode() with no equivalent guard — so every
  ~20-60s WhatsApp-side QR rotation generates a BRAND NEW pairing code,
  faster than a screen-reader user can read an 8-character code.

* v1 (WinZapp's first fix, shipped, then found unsafe): a
  `linkCodeGenerated` latch set to True BEFORE loginByCode() actually
  produced a code, cleared only on a successful login. Reported live: the
  fast rotation stopped, but the code then never updated again even after
  10 minutes — because the latch never gets reset if a refresh is ever
  legitimately needed (or if the very first loginByCode() call failed).

* v2: a 60-second reuse cooldown instead of a permanent latch, with the
  "issued" timestamp only recorded AFTER a code is actually produced, so a
  failed attempt self-recovers on the next tick instead of freezing forever.

* v3: v2 plus a catch around the loginByCode() call, and a companion patch to
  loginByCode() itself. v2's try/finally had no catch, so a rejected
  loginByCode() escaped checkQrCode() — which is called fire-and-forget — as
  an unhandled rejection, and the underlying browser error had already been
  flattened to the minified "t: t" by crossing the CDP exception boundary.
  Observed live: pairing simply never produced a code, the Python side sat
  out its full 90-second wait, and the only trace anywhere was "Unhandled
  Rejection: t: t" in wppconnect.log.

* v4: v3 plus a `catchLinkCodeError` hook, so the caught error actually
  reaches the person trying to pair. v3 made the failure real and non-fatal,
  but it still only ever landed in wppconnect.log — the user was left with the
  same generic "no pairing code received" after 90 seconds. The end-to-end
  path is covered by tests/test_pairing_code_error_reporting.py.

* v6 (current): the phoneNumber branch waits for WhatsApp Web's auth state
  before calling the link-device API, and getQrCode() reads the payload from
  wa-js instead of scraping the DOM. Both pairing routes were dead at the same
  time for unrelated reasons that looked identical from the outside (nothing
  appears on screen): the code threw Invariant Violation #56367 because v1..v5
  had hoisted its branch above the `await this.getQrCode()` that used to
  guarantee the auth state existed, and the QR emitted nothing because
  upstream's scraper looks for a <canvas> WhatsApp Web no longer renders —
  landing instead on the download banner's `https://wa.me/...` data-ref, which
  is not a login payload at all.

* v5: a doubling backoff between consecutive failures. v2's cooldown
  only ever gates a success, so a run of failures was paced by nothing at all —
  measured live at one attempt every 20 seconds, nine and counting, which for a
  failure that is plausibly rate-limiting made the problem self-sustaining.

Both setup_api.py and ApiSetupDialog (client/ui/dialogs/api_setup.py) apply
the same patch (see the "why two places" comment in api_setup.py). Since v3
both delegate the actual search-and-replace to patch_host_layer_source() in
client/core/wppconnect_host_layer_patch.py, so this file exercises that
shared module plus each of the two patch-applying entry points.

    v7's bug, found independently: `needsToScan(...).catch(() => null)` answers
    null when a navigation destroys the execution context, and `!null` is
    `true`, so a probe that could not answer was read as "the user is logged
    in". Upstream now guards both call sites.

    That moved the source text out from under two patches at once, which is the
    failure this class pins: on 2.3.3 both were reported DID NOT MATCH and
    silently skipped — the same shape as the 2.3.2 regression above, which is
    why the runtime is pinned exactly and why every bump re-runs this.
