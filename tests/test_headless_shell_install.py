"""The browser is part of "is the install complete?", and it never used to be.

Every check in _ensure_api_modules_installed() looks at client/api/ — is
dist/server.js there, is node_modules there — and not one of them looks at
whether a browser exists. So "the API is fully set up" was true for an install
with no browser at all, and the only thing that would fetch one was start.js's
own execSync fallback, running inside the API process at boot.

That placement is the problem this module's code guards:

  * ApiStartupDialog gives the API 300 s to come up (_TIMEOUT_S). A download
    happening inside start.js spends that budget before the server has even
    started listening, so a slow connection turns a one-off browser download
    into "WinZapp failed to start the API".
  * ensure_api_modules_installed() runs *before* ensure_wpp_running(), i.e.
    before that timer starts. Downloading here costs the same wait but cannot
    trip the timeout.

Who actually reaches it: not fresh installs — ApiSetupDialog's step 4.5 fetches
the shell as part of its own progress UI. It is everyone *updating* from a
build that shipped full Chrome. Their .cache already holds a chrome.exe, so
every existing check passes, and without this nothing would ever fetch the
shell that start.js now looks for.

Best-effort on purpose: a failure is logged, not fatal, because start.js's
fallback still gets its turn and a full Chrome already in the cache still
works.
