"""The executable WPPConnect runtime is one homologated pair, pinned exactly.

WinZapp does not ship "some WPPConnect Server plus whatever npm resolves". It
ships a *pair*: one server tag (client/wpp_minimum_version.txt) together with
the one @wppconnect-team/wppconnect + @wppconnect/wa-js release its patch set
was actually validated against. Those two packages are compiled code running
inside WhatsApp Web, and WinZapp reaches into them directly — the node_modules
patches in client/core/wppconnect_*_patch.py rewrite them by literal
search-and-replace, and deviceController.ts drives private WA-JS loader APIs.

Left on upstream's caret range, a plain `npm install` of the *same* server tag
could move the browser-side send and status APIs underneath an unchanged
WinZapp build, with nothing failing until a user tried to send something. That
is why the pin is back. Moving it is a deliberate act: bump this pair and
client/wpp_minimum_version.txt in the same commit, after actually running
against the new one.

Two independent installers have to agree, for the same reason CLAUDE.md gives
for the node_modules patches — setup_api.py runs for dev/CI, ApiSetupDialog
runs on the end user's machine (where npm install re-fetches everything from
scratch), and a policy enforced in only one of them is enforced for nobody.

@wppconnect/wa-version is deliberately NOT part of the pair: it is the
expiring catalogue of WhatsApp Web builds, not an API surface, and pinning it
would freeze an install onto a catalogue whose entries stop being served.
