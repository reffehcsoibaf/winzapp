"""Tests for Connect.on_dialog_close()/on_quit_from_connect() not tearing
down a currently-live WhatsApp connection.

Reported live (issue #155): an account paired and worked normally for an
entire session — messages synced, nothing visibly wrong — yet the very next
launch showed the pairing dialog again, as if never paired. The account's
WPPConnect session, its Chrome userDataDir profile, and its sessions.json
entry were all still intact and reusable (confirmed by manually restoring
the encrypted token from sessions.json into settings.json, after which the
same session kept working across further restarts) — only the token
reference in settings.json had disappeared, with `paired` left `true`.

The connection dialog (client/ui/dialogs/connect.py) can now open on its
own while an account is already paired — websocket_client.py's
_show_repair_dialog(), the proactive re-pair dialog — and WhatsApp can
reconnect in the background in the time before a user reacts to it (the
dialog is sometimes not even seen for many seconds — see
tests/test_qrcode_auto_repair_dialog.py). Both on_dialog_close() and
on_quit_from_connect() used to assume the opposite: that a dialog on screen
always means nothing usable is connected yet, so closing or quitting from
it unconditionally disconnected the live WebSocket and cleared the saved
token via _close_active_session() — exactly the observed symptom, since
_close_active_session() never touches `paired` or the SessionStore entry,
only the token reference (see _set_wa_token("") in main.py).

Connect is a plain class — same approach as tests/test_pairing_startup_grace.py.
