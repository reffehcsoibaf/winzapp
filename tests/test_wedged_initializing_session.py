"""A failed session start must never be able to wedge the account offline.

Measured on a real install on 2026-09-09, and the account was offline in
silence for the rest of the launch:

    09:49:38  QR for a paired install -> _recover_suspect_profile() starts;
              close-session, then wait_for_profile_release() for up to 20 s
    09:49:52  the 30 s health poll reads CLOSED and fires its own
              /start-session into a profile Chrome is still holding
    09:49:54  Error: The browser is already running for ...userDataDir\\47d16ae...
    09:49:58  Python kills the ten Chrome processes holding the lock
    09:49:59  profile restored from the snapshot -- the same bytes that had
              connected fine eight hours earlier
    09:50:22  status-session INITIALIZING ... and every 30 s after that,
              forever, with no chrome.exe in existence

The restore worked. Nothing could start a session on it. Confirmed live
against the still-running server: status-session answered INITIALIZING and
POST /start-session answered HTTP 200 while launching no browser at all.

Two independent faults, either one enough on its own, so both are pinned here:

* createSessionUtil()'s catch reset the status to CLOSED only for a
  TimeoutError. "The browser is already running" is a plain Error, so the
  status stayed INITIALIZING -- and INITIALIZING is terminal on both sides:
  createSessionUtil() returns early for any status but CLOSED, and
  check_wa_connection_http() skips /start-session for every "active" state.
* _recover_suspect_profile() owns the browser and the profile for the whole
  close/kill/restore cycle and said so to nobody, so the health poll raced it.
  _recovery_restart_active is the flag that exists for exactly this.

The TypeScript only compiles inside client/api/, which does not exist in the
test job, so the Node half is asserted against the patched source the way
tests/test_stale_browser_lock_recovery.py does for the same file.
