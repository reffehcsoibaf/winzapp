"""Tests that drive the real _run_sync() retry loop, not a replica of it.

tests/test_chat_list_settled.py keeps a hand-written copy of this loop so the
settle *decisions* can be exercised as pure functions. That copy has drifted
from the real loop before — the whole suite stayed green over a branch it
covered nothing of — and by construction it can never cover the wiring: which
number is passed as evidence, whether the growth guard is consulted, whether
the deadline veto is called at all. Those live only in _run_sync().

So these bind _run_sync() itself to a stub and let it run, with every
collaborator past the chat-list fetch reduced to a no-op. What is asserted is
only what the loop decides: how many times it asked, whether the sync was
marked complete, and whether the session was recreated.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running wx.App,
so the method is bound to a plain object — the same pattern the other main.py
tests use.

        page, every name resolves, nothing is still landing — so all three of
        the old reasons are zero and the sync ended announcing success with the
        older history untouched. A restart lands in the same state, so the walk
        could not resume either: the SQLite anchor survived and nothing ever
        came back for it.
