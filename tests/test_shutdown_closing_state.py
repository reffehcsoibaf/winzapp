"""Tests for the two halves of the shutdown gate telling the truth.

A user's WhatsApp session kept coming back unpaired after a restart, on a build
that already had every previous shutdown fix. Their shutdown_audit.log showed
the clean path completing inside one second:

    00:46:59  _stop_wpp_server START  pre_close_status='CONNECTED'
    00:46:59  close-session POSTed — waiting for flush
    00:47:00  flush poll #1 status='CLOSED' elapsed=0.1s
    00:47:00  FLUSH OK — session reached CLOSED
    00:47:00  taskkill /F /T node pid=2252 (flush done above)
    00:47:09  STARTUP  paired=True   →  "Session Unpaired", QR

That 0.1s is not a fast flush, it is a constant. closeSession() parked
`{status: null}` in clientsArray BEFORE awaiting client.close(), and
getSessionState() answers 'CLOSED' for a null status — so status-session
reported CLOSED the instant the close began, and _wait_for_session_flushed()
was satisfied on poll #1 before anything had been written. Every audited
shutdown in the repo shows the same 0.1s/0.2s signature, including the one
quoted in test_shutdown_flushes_profile.py.

The placeholder is now 'CLOSING', which is deliberately NOT a
session_closed_after_flush() state, so the poll waits for the real transition.

Second half: _on_end_session runs this teardown while Windows is shutting the
machine down. _on_query_end_session registers a ShutdownBlockReason but still
answers TRUE to WM_QUERYENDSESSION (event.Skip()), and registering a reason
without also vetoing buys no time at all — so the real deadline is the hung-app
timeout, ~5s, against per-phase timeouts summing to ~40s. Windows would cut the
teardown off partway: the same mid-write kill, plus a frozen UI.
