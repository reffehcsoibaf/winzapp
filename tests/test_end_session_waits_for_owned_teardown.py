"""WM_ENDSESSION must not hand the process to Windows mid-teardown.

PR #141 correctly locked the _shutting_down check-and-set so a local quit, an
IPC quit and WM_ENDSESSION can no longer run _stop_wpp_server() concurrently.
But its losing branch — "teardown already started elsewhere" — destroyed the
shutdown block reason and returned at once, which is precisely what tells
Windows it may terminate now.

The damage that causes is documented in CLAUDE.md: a run whose
shutdown_audit.log shows STARTUP with no _stop_wpp_server before it was killed
rather than closed, WhatsApp's auth state never reached userDataDir, and the
profile comes back unusable — the session-loss symptom this whole PR is about.

The old code at least ran its own budgeted _stop_wpp_server() and flushed
something. The fix is to wait on the winning path's _teardown_complete_event,
bounded by the same Windows budget.
