"""The warm half of _run_sync()'s history gate — the branch almost every
launch actually takes, and the one nothing exercised.

The gate has two sides. The cold one (_force_full_sync=True: first pairing, F5,
an empty local cache) unblocks WhatsApp Web's history queue, waits for the
RECENT transfer and re-reads whether history is still landing; that side is
covered by tests/test_run_sync_history_gate.py, which sets _force_full_sync
True in its own stub precisely so it keeps reaching it. The warm one skips all
of that and asserts _history_still_landing = False.

Nothing was left watching the warm side. A regression there does not raise and
does not fail a round: it declares the synchronization finished while history
is still arriving, and the user sees conversations missing history and unread
badges that are simply wrong — the exact failure the gate was written for, and
one that only shows up in real use. So what these pin down is not that the warm
path runs, but that skipping the unblock costs it nothing: a chat that comes
back short is still repaired, the backfill still starts, and the completion
marker still waits for the message delta.

Writing them turned up one place where skipping the gate did cost the warm
round something, and it is fixed in the same change: the warm branch used to
*assert* _history_still_landing = False instead of reading it.
_note_backfill_state()'s short-page rule is
`still_landing or grew or first_short_page`, and a chat restored from
backfill_pending_v1 has first_short_page False — it was seen last session — so
one that answered short without growing had all three terms False and was
retired from the repair queue while WhatsApp Web was still decoding it. The
warm branch now reads the flag (one GET) while still skipping what is actually
expensive: the RECENT restart and the ten-minute wait.
TestARestoredShortChatIsNotRetiredEarly is that regression, both directions.

The stub harness is tests/test_run_sync_broken_store.py's, imported rather than
copied for the reason that module's own docstring gives.
