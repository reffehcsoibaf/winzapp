"""Regression test: a sound event disabled before the soundpack system
existed silently went back to "enabled" after the app updated.

Sound.play() (core/sound_system.py) only ever reads the nested shape
settings["sound_events"][pack_id][event_key] — that's the shape the
soundpack restructuring introduced. An install whose settings.json still had
the old flat shape (settings["sound_events"][event_key], from before
soundpacks existed) never got migrated, so every lookup under a real pack_id
came back empty and "enabled" silently defaulted back to True — e.g. the
startup sound played again even though Settings still showed it as
disabled, because nothing there was reading the field it still lived under.

MainWindow._migrate_settings() now detects and rewrites the old flat shape
into {DEFAULT_PACK_ID: {...}} on load. Exercised as a plain function bound
to a stub, per the project's convention for MainWindow (a wx.Frame) — see
tests/test_reported_bugfixes.py.
