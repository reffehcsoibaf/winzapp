"""Tests for MainWindow._on_end_session()'s self-healing _shutting_down reset.

_shutting_down is never reset anywhere else in the codebase, and every
logout-detection guard added against the self-inflicted-close bug
(on_connection_update's "close" branch, on_wpp_status_find,
check_wa_connection_http's CLOSED auto-start) now trusts it permanently for
the rest of the process's life once set. _on_end_session() sets it on
WM_ENDSESSION (Windows telling the app the machine is shutting down) --  but
per Windows' own documented semantics WM_ENDSESSION's bEnding can in
principle still be FALSE (another app vetoed a shutdown this one already
got as far as receiving notice of). If that ever happens and the process
keeps running, _shutting_down would otherwise stay True forever, silently
disabling real logout detection for the rest of the session.

WebSocketClient/MainWindow are not directly involved here; only
_on_end_session and the timer it arms are exercised, bound onto a stub (no
wx.App / real Windows session needed).
