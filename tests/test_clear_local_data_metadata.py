"""Tests for the in-memory half of clear_local_data(wipe_metadata=True).

The wipe used to be partial. prepare_sync() reads deleted/archived/pinned/
muted chats, the block list, the presence push-name map, locally_read_at and
my_jid/my_lid OUT of the system_metadata table into RAM at startup, and every
caller of clear_local_data() up to now ran BEFORE that load — so emptying the
table was enough. _wipe_local_data_if_another_number_linked() is the first one
that runs after it, and there the table went while account A's sets stayed
live in the process.

What that produces is not a cosmetic leak. Account A had
5511988887777@s.whatsapp.net deleted (or muted, archived, pinned). Phone B
pairs by QR and talks to that same contact — two phones in one family or one
company, which is the ordinary case of this bug. The database is emptied, then
B's first sync writes A's sets straight back into B's database:
get_remote_chats() persists muted/pinned/archived, the chat-list build persists
the deleted set. That conversation then never appears in B's list at all, or
appears silenced/archived, and it stays that way on disk. my_jid is the same
story one level down — it holds A's JID until the first CONNECTED, and
_resolve_self_referential_jid() sends a conversation of B's with the old number
to the "Eu" self-chat.

wipe_metadata=False (F5/resync) must preserve every one of them — that is the
entire point of the flag, and resyncing used to silently undo all of those
local actions.

The media sweep at the end of the method is here too, for a failure of the
same family: one entry Windows refuses to delete — a voice note BASS still has
open is the measured case — used to abort the sweep of its whole directory
from that point on, leaving the rest of the previous account's files on disk.
