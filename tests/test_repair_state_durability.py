"""Everything a sync round has to remember across a restart, and who reads it.

An incremental round decides what to fetch by comparing the server's chat list
against the activity markers already on disk. That comparison is only safe
while the client also remembers what it still *owes*: a chat whose first page
never arrived, a known hole in the middle of a conversation, a delta whose
request failed after list-chats had already advanced the marker. Forget any of
those on restart and the next launch sees an ordinary unchanged chat and never
queries it again — silently, and for good.

So each of them is written under its own metadata key and each is read back by
prepare_sync(). These cover the writing half and the consumer that acts on what
was restored; the reading half is pinned separately at the bottom, and that
test explains why it is the shape it is.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running wx.App,
so the methods are bound to plain stubs — the pattern the other main.py tests
use.
