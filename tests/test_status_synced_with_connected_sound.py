"""Tests that the "preparing_to_sync" status text changes at the exact same
moment connected_sound plays — not earlier.

Reported live: prepare_sync() (called synchronously during __init__, well
before the window/tray even exist and long before the connection is
actually confirmed) used to set the "preparing_to_sync" status itself. The
window ended up appearing already on "Preparando para sincronizar" with
connected_sound only playing several seconds later, once
_set_wa_connected(True) actually ran — the "Conectando..." status the user
expects to see until the sound fires was skipped every time. Fixed by
having _set_wa_connected(True)'s first-ever-connect branch (the same branch
that plays the sound) set the status too, and having
wait_messages_set() not set it at all anymore.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running wx.App,
so _set_wa_connected() is exercised as a plain function against a stub —
same approach as tests/test_startup_grace.py.
