# ── Fixtures: wx ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



# ── wxgui: opt-in, because the default must be safe for a blind developer ────
#
# A plain `pytest` has to be safe to run on the machine somebody is using.
# Tests marked `wxgui` construct a real top-level wx dialog, which takes
# foreground focus away from whatever the developer is doing - and has crashed
# NVDA outright: NVDA takes focus on the throwaway window and is still
# enumerating its children over COM (event_gainFocus -> getDialogText ->
# IAccessible._get_children -> oleacc.AccessibleObjectFromEvent) when the test
# destroys it. Confirmed live from NVDA's own traceback.
#
# WinZapp exists for blind users and is maintained by blind developers, so
# "remember to pass -m 'not wxgui'" is the wrong default: the cost of
# forgetting falls on the person least able to absorb it, and it is not their
# test run that breaks - it is whatever they were doing in another window.
#
# So these are skipped unless explicitly asked for, by `--run-wx-gui` or
# WINZAPP_RUN_WX_GUI_TESTS=1. Every CI workflow passes the flag (enforced by
# tests/test_no_desktop_visible_windows.py), so the coverage is never actually
# lost - it just stops running on a human's desktop by accident.

    """Seconds taken by the quickest of *repeats* runs of ``call``.

    The load tests assert that doubling the data does not more than double the
    work. Timing a single run makes that assertion unreliable in exactly one
    direction: noise is one-sided — a sample can only ever come out slower than
    the truth, never faster — so one unlucky garbage collection inside the
    larger measurement inflates the ratio without any code having changed.

    Measured in a full suite run on 2026-09-10: the 2,000-chat planning call
    was recorded at 69.9 ms against a median of 6.5 ms on the same machine,
    while the 500-chat call was recorded at its clean 1.6 ms — "44.1x for 4x
    the chats", failing the build over an implementation that is perfectly
    linear (3.2 microseconds per chat, flat from 250 to 4,000 chats).

    That is worth a helper rather than a local fix, because a red run is not
    the worst outcome: release.yml builds nothing when its test job fails, so a
    test that fails at random blocks a good stable release (and an alpha).

    The minimum is the right statistic precisely because of the one-sidedness:
    it converges on the cost of the work itself, and it still grows when the
    work genuinely grows, which is all these assertions read.

    makes any test touching the notification path pass or fail according to
    whatever the machine running it happens to be doing — and a headless
    GitHub Actions runner is not doing the same thing as a developer desktop.

    It cost an alpha release to learn that twice. The gate started out
    covering only the background sound, so a handful of files monkeypatched it
    one by one and that was enough. Then it grew to suppress the entire
    notification — banner included — and every _dispatch() test in

    and tests/test_repair_state_durability.py — all need the same two fields

    is classified full on every path, which is exactly the shape that cannot

    transiently refuse a write right after another Open/Close cycle elsewhere
    in the same process — reproduced by running the clipboard tests after
    enough other wx-using tests earlier in a full suite run.

    Two things make that refusal invisible if you do not handle it here:

    * A failed SetData() leaves the PREVIOUS content in place, and the
      clipboard still opens fine — so a caller that only checks Open() reads
      some earlier test's data and asserts happily against it. Hence checking
      SetData()'s return value, and retrying.
    * Clear() first, so that if every attempt somehow fails the clipboard is
      empty rather than stale: the test then fails honestly instead of
      passing on someone else's data.

    Flush() is deliberately NOT called. It asks the OS to render every format
    so the data outlives the owning process; these tests read the clipboard
    back in the same process with the wx.App still alive, so it buys nothing
    and is one more thing that can block or be refused.
