"""A Chrome profile that restores its tabs starves the page WPPConnect drives.

WPPConnect drives exactly one page. When the session's Chrome profile reopens
the tabs it had last time, that page gets company — and the company is actively
harmful rather than merely untidy, because Chrome opens those tabs itself:

  * they never pass through start.js's document-only interception, so they load
    whatever build Meta is serving right now instead of the pinned one;
  * they never receive wppconnect's user-agent override, so WhatsApp answers
    them with the unsupported-browser screen and no wa-js runs in them at all;
  * they still share the profile's IndexedDB and its single WAWebBackendWorker
    with the page that matters.

Measured live on 2026-09-10 by attaching to the wedged browser over its own
DevTools port. Three ``web.whatsapp.com`` targets in one profile::

    ua=Chrome/102.0.5005.63        title="(30) WhatsApp"   WPP.isReady=true
    ua=HeadlessChrome/148.0.0.0    title=""                WPP undefined
    ua=HeadlessChrome/148.0.0.0    title=""                WPP undefined

The two extras were created 0.6 s *before* puppeteer's own page — they are a
session restore, not something the app opened. The page that mattered did reach
``WPP.isReady``, but only after ``injectApi()``'s 30 s bound had already
expired, so the session was reported dead. Nothing was logged out; it was
starved. On a fresh profile with the same Chrome, the same pinned build and the
same wa-js, ``WAPI && Store && WPP.isReady`` came back true in 3.1 s.

The loop is self-feeding, which is why it never recovered on its own: the
timeout leaves Chrome alive, the recovery force-kills it, a force-killed Chrome
records no clean exit, and the next launch therefore restores the tabs of the
run before — one more each time. Fifteen orphan Chromes had accumulated behind
the profile by the time it was looked at.

createSessionUtil.ts is TypeScript that only compiles inside client/api/, which
does not exist in the test job, so this asserts against the patched source the
way tests/test_stale_browser_lock_recovery.py does for the same file. The one
piece that is real behaviour rather than structure — which filenames the sweep
selects — is extracted and exercised directly, because deleting the wrong file
in a Chrome profile is a much worse bug than the one being fixed.
