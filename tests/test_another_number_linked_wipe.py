"""Tests for the post-pairing "is this even the same phone?" check.

start_qrcode_connection(preserve_local_data=...) keys its wipe on "this
installation had a working history a moment ago", which is not the same
question as "is this the same number". Pair account A, open the dialog, switch
to QR mode and scan with phone B and the wipe is skipped: A's messages.db,
media/ and voice_messages/ survive while B's sync merges on top of them — the
merge clear_local_data() exists to prevent.

MainWindow._wipe_local_data_if_another_number_linked() closes that gap by
asking WPPConnect, once pairing has closed, which phone actually linked. It
deletes the user's history, so every test below is really about the same
property: it may act on proof of divergence and on nothing else. In particular
a freshly created multi-account entry is `pending` with an empty privateinfo
and no session token, and must never so much as reach the probe.

**Both sides of the comparison are a phone WhatsApp itself confirmed.** The
first version of this check read privateinfo["WA_phone_number"], which holds
what the user typed into the pairing dialog — written by connect.py the moment
a pairing code arrives, before the pairing concludes, and never restored when
the attempt is abandoned. So this sequence, in one session, deleted the whole
history of a user who had paired their own phone: session drops, repair dialog
opens, "connect with phone number", a digit typed wrong, the code arrives (
WhatsApp mints one for any number), the mistake is noticed, back to QR, scanned
with the right phone. The check then compared the mistyped number against the
real one and wiped. The confirmed number now lives under its own key,
WA_phone_number_linked, written by this method and nothing else.

The mirror-image half is here too: an install that has never been through this
check carries no such key, and that absence means "learn it now, delete
nothing". That branch is not the migration, though — it is reached for the
first time on a pairing, which is precisely the pairing that may already have
linked another phone. record_linked_phone_if_unknown() is the migration: it
learns the number from an ordinary connection, before anybody scans anything.

The other half of these tests is what surrounds the wipe mid-session. By the
time this check starts, a sync of the newly paired account is nearly always
already in flight — started synchronously by the event that concluded the
pairing, before the dialog even closed — holding the previous account's chats.
The wipe alone does not deal with it: _try_start_sync_thread() refuses to start
anything while that round lives, so the corrective full sync silently never
happens, and the round keeps writing until it exits.

    The event that concludes the pairing does it synchronously and before the

    on_connection_update({state: "open"}) — _set_wa_connected(True) →
    _sync_completed = False → trigger_sync_if_needed() — and then
    on_messages_set(), which goes straight to _try_start_sync_thread() without
    consulting _initial_sync_running at all. Only afterwards does
    on_pairing_complete() end the modal loop, so show_connection_dial() can
    return and start the thread this check runs on.

    That round captured self.chats holding account A's chats and is merging
    B's list onto them. Two separate consequences, and the wipe fixes neither:
    _try_start_sync_thread() answers "there is already one running" and starts
    nothing, so the corrective full sync never happens and nothing ever fires
    again; and the round keeps writing until it exits, so what it commits
    after the wipe survives it — in self.chats too, which the corrective round
    would merge onto rather than replace.
