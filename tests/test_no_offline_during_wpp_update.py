"""Tests that a WPPConnect update is not *announced* as an outage — while
still being treated as one everywhere the app holds work back.

`_update_wpp_server()` stops the server on purpose. The socket drops, every
probe fails, and nothing answers until the reinstall finishes — two or three
minutes on a real update. Announcing "desconectado do WhatsApp" through that
window is wrong, and it frightens people: two field reports describe the update
as leaving the app "flipping between offline and normal". That is the message,
not the mechanism.

There was already a `_wpp_updating` flag for exactly this, but it was consulted
in one place only — the health checker. `WebSocketClient`'s confirmed-socket-drop
path went straight to `_set_wa_connected(False, "socket disconnected")`, and that
is the one that fired: observed at 17:48:26 during a real 2.10.6 -> 2.10.10
update, seconds after the server was stopped deliberately.

The guard now sits at the single place that decides the message, so it cannot be
half-applied across callers again.

**Why two tests here changed their expectation.** The guard first returned
*before* `_auto_offline = True` / `_apply_offline_state()`, and those two tests
asserted that (`offline_applied is False`). That over-shot the intent: the fix
was meant to be presentational, but skipping the recompute also left
`self.offline_mode` False, and `MessageQueue._run` holds sends only while it is
True. A message sent moments before the user accepted the update was therefore
still attempted, against the already-stopped server; the
`requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` that came back is classified *ambiguous*
by `_classify_send_exception()` — a timeout can mean WhatsApp Web accepted the
message into its own outbox, where a resend would duplicate it — so the queue
dropped it without resending. The pending bubble resolved to nothing and the
message never arrived. That ambiguity does not apply to an update:
`_stop_wpp_server()` has just killed Node and Chrome, so nothing anywhere holds
the message. Offline mode is now engaged exactly as a real outage engages it,
and only the sound/speech/"desconectado" text stay suppressed.

Suppressing the announcement while the state *is* offline needs one more thing:
if the server never comes back, the offline state is already in place, so the
"nothing changed" early return at the top of `_set_wa_connected()` would swallow
the health check that finally notices — a genuine outage silent for the rest of
the session, with the status stuck on "conectando".
`_offline_announce_deferred` is what lets that one call through.
