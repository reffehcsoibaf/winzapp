"""Tests for repainting only the rows a resolved batch can have changed.

The message window stopped having a ceiling when it started preserving the
history the user pulls in with Home (see
tests/test_history_window_preservation.py), so a conversation can legitimately
sit at thousands of rows. Every one of them used to be re-rendered by
``refresh_active_conversation_messages()`` once per resolved batch — and the
three background loops that trigger it ([Contact Resolution], [Mentions Scan]
and [LID Resolution]) deliver batches continuously for minutes on a fresh
account, while each batch typically renames a single person. The scheduler was
a signal with no payload even though those loops know exactly which JIDs they
just resolved.

Two halves are pinned here, and the second one is where the accessibility risk
sits:

* ``MainWindow._schedule_refresh_active_messages(jids)`` accumulates the JIDs
  across every batch inside one debounce window, drains them when it fires, and
  keeps ``None``/empty meaning "I don't know what changed, repaint everything".

* ``ConversationsPanel.refresh_active_conversation_messages(jids=...)`` repaints
  a row when *any* JID the row renders a name for — sender, quoted sender,
  mentions in the body, mentions in the quoted preview — matches, compared
  across the @lid <-> phone bridge rather than as raw strings. A row wrongly
  left out does not merely look stale: ``_get_participant_name()`` falls back to
  ``participant_jid.rsplit("@", 1)[0]``, i.e. the screen reader reads raw @lid
  or phone digits, forever. So anything the selective path cannot address
  (a matching row carrying no ``key.id``) must fall back to the full repaint.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and ConversationsPanel a wx.Panel, so both are driven
as unbound methods against small stubs — same approach as
tests/test_refresh_messages_debounce.py and
tests/test_history_window_preservation.py.
