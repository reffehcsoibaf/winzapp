"""Synthetic load tests for a freshly-connected account with many chats.

Run from the repository root::

    python -m pytest -s -q tests/load/test_large_account_sync_load.py

``WINZAPP_LOAD_CHAT_COUNT`` sets the scenario size (default 2,000 chats, which
is comfortably past the ~1,000 a busy real account carries).

What is being looked for here is not speed. It is the class of bug that only
appears at size, which in this codebase has always been the same shape: **a
cost, a failure list or a phone-notification budget that grows with the number
of chats when it must not.** Each of the three below is a claim CLAUDE.md makes
in prose and nothing enforced:

  * the staleness net costs "a fixed amount per round however large the account
    grows" (issue #181);
  * a chat the server answers definitively — an empty delta, or a chat that no
    longer exists — is not an I/O failure, and one of them must never hold the
    whole account in "not synced" (which stops the list-chats snapshot being
    committed for *every* chat, and makes the health checker announce a resync
    out loud on every cooldown);
  * the per-pass phone-history budget is one request, no matter how many chats
    are queued behind it, because each one puts a sync notification on the
    user's phone (issue #108).

Fixed time thresholds are deliberately avoided — CI and developer machines have
very different performance profiles — so the timing assertions are *relative*:
double the account, and the work must not more than double. That catches an
accidental O(n²) without pinning a number that will flake.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated, so the methods under test
are bound to plain stubs, exactly as tests/test_repair_state_durability.py and
tests/test_periodic_poll_delta.py do.
