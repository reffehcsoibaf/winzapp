"""Refuse a stable release tag that already-published alpha builds outrank.

Alpha builds (.github/workflows/alpha-release.yml) are versioned
``<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<commit count>alpha`` off the current stable version,
so they consume the fourth component. A stable release that only bumps that
fourth component therefore sorts BELOW alphas that are already out — and
client/updater.py would never offer it to anyone running one, stranding every
alpha user permanently with no error anywhere.

Run from .github/workflows/release.yml's test job, so that a failure reaches
`reject-on-test-failure` and the bad release is deleted rather than left on the
Releases page looking normal.

This lives in a file rather than inline in the workflow because getting it
wrong is expensive in both directions: a false negative strands alpha users, and
a false positive deletes a perfectly good release. tests/test_release_ordering_guard.py
covers it.
