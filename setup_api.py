WinZapp — WPPConnect Server setup script.

Clones the WPPConnect Server repository into client/api/ and optionally checks
out a specific tag. After cloning, follow the build instructions printed at
the end to compile the API before running build.py.

Configuration (via .env at the project root):
  WPPCONNECT_TAG_VERSION  — git tag to pin to. Leave unset or empty to
                            auto-track the latest stable (non-prerelease)
                            release tag instead — this script fetches tags
                            and updates client/api/ to it on every run, even
                            when client/api/ already exists from a previous
                            run.

# Files WinZapp patches on top of upstream wppconnect-server. client/api_patches/
# is the permanent, always-git-tracked source of truth for all of these —
# preferred below over whatever (if anything) happens to still be sitting in
# client/api/ right before it gets wiped. That "stash what's currently there"
# fallback used to be the ONLY restore path, and is worthless the moment
# client/api/ is already gone (e.g. a user deletes it before reinstalling,
# reported live as every patch silently regressing to whatever old snapshot
# happened to get stashed months earlier) — client/api_patches/ never has
# that problem since it's never inside the folder that gets deleted.
#
# These are FULL-FILE restores, so any upstream change to one of them is
# silently discarded on the next setup run. That is the intended trade — our
# copies are the patches — but it means a server bump has to be read as "what
# did upstream change in these 28 files", not only "does it still build".
#
# Audited at wppconnect-server 2.10.18 (2026-09-07). 2.10.17 added the Manager
# dashboard and wired it into four of them (jest.config.js, src/index.ts,
# src/util/createSessionUtil.ts, src/types/express/index.d.ts); every one of
# those hooks is an emitManager()/installManager*() call feeding a web UI
# WinZapp does not use, so dropping them costs nothing. The one substantive
# change, `io: Socket` -> `io: Server` in the express typings, our copy already
# carried as `Server as Socket`. 2.10.18 itself touched no source file at all —
# it is a dependency bump moving @wppconnect-team/wppconnect from ^2.2.7 to
# ^2.3.3, which is why the homologated pin had to reach 2.3.3 first.
#
# package.json is NOT in this list — see _merge_package_json_dependencies().
# It used to be a full-file overwrite like the others, which meant its
# "version" field (WPPConnect Server's own self-reported version — what
# WppUpdateChecker compares against the latest GitHub release) came from
# whatever was checked into api_patches/package.json at the time, not from
# whatever tag was actually cloned/checked out here. Reported live: WinZapp
# insisting its installed version was still 2.10.0 on a build that had
# genuinely cloned/built 2.10.1, because api_patches/package.json's own
# "version" field had gone stale.
